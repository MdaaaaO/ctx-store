# Only prose counts. Stripped first: HTML comments (the PR template's own hint says "Closes #"),
# fenced code blocks and `inline code` — a PR that *describes* the syntax, or quotes a log,
# must not link (and later close, and move the card of) the issues in its examples. GitHub's
# own auto-close ignores code spans the same way.
# Bash and sed only (no perl), the same on GNU and BSD: the two multi-line spans go by parameter
# expansion — first opener to the first closer after it, as a non-greedy match would; one left
# unclosed stays — and inline code line by line with sed, since a code span never crosses a line.
